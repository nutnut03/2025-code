      <h1>About Merise English Academy</h1>
      <p>MeRISE English Academy is a top-notch English Language School, formerly known as United Re-Growth Philippines
        Inc. Masters of Business English Academy (URG-MBA). It is a language academy specializing in General English,
        Business English, and Pronunciation teaching. It is the goal of the Academy to provide the best English language
        training for our students. Thus, the Academy requires instructors to undergo extensive teacher-training courses.

        MeRISE English Academy is proud to say that all our instructors are highly trained and have certifications
        related to English language teaching. MeRISE faculty take into heart what students need. Headed by the Academic
        Team, our instructors are trained to provide lessons customized and tailored to fit students’ levels, needs, and
        requests.

        Aside from competent teachers, the Academy also provides students with a holistic educational experience. The
        Academy is housed in an 8-story building conducive to learning. The building offers students a dormitory with
        state-of-the-art facilities and the services of a hotel. With students’ needs in mind, the ground floor of the
        building was intentionally leased to a restaurant that provides Japanese and Western fusion treats and dishes. A
        laundromat, convenience store, and salon-spa business can also be found on the ground floor of the building for
        students’ ease and convenience.</p>
